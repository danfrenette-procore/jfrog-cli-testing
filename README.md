# JFrog CLI Troubleshooting Guide for Curation Audit on Yarn Projects

This repository contains a sample yarn project that demonstrates issues we're experiencing with the JFrog CLI tool when working with yarn-based projects.

## Prerequisites

- macOS (this guide uses Homebrew for installation)
- Node.js and yarn installed
- Homebrew installed

## Installing JFrog CLI

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to install JFrog CLI using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install jfrog-cli
```

2. Verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
jfrog -v
```

The most recent version of the JFrog CLI is 2.74.0. which will be shown in the output:

```
jf version 2.74.0
```

## Project Setup

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danfrenette-procore/jfrog-cli-testing
cd jfrog-cli-testing
```

2. Install yarn dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Reproducing the Issue

The issue occurs when trying to use JFrog CLI with yarn projects. To reproduce:

1. Configure JFrog CLI to use your Artifactory instance:

Follow the prompts to configure your JFrog platform instance.

2. Attempt to run curation with the JFrog CLI:

Use debug mode to gather more information about the issue.

```bash
export JFROG_CLI_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
jf ca
```

3. Observe the error:

[Info] It looks like this project uses 'yarn' to download its dependencies. This package manager however isn't supported by this command.
```


## Expected Behavior

JFrog CLI should work seamlessly with yarn projects, similar to how it works with npm projects.

## Actual Behavior

The JFrog CLI should not throw an error about the unsupported package manager.
